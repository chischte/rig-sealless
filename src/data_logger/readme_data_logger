DATA LOGGER

The Controllino PLC provides the raspberry_log_merger with following info:
    cycle-number
    start of tensioning
    tension force
    start of crimping

The arduino_current_logger provides the raspberry_log merger with following info:
    peak current of the next n seconds as soon as current raises above threshold x switch_step_auto_mode_push

The raspberry_log_merger receives all info, combines them to logs and pushes the logs to firebase
A log in firebase should look something like this:
    2021-08-31; CycleCount=3252; TensionForce=2532N; TensionCurrentMax=32A;CrimpCurrentMax=24A
